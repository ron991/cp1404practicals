# Write a program that asks the user how many "quick picks" they wish to generate. The program then generates that many lines of output. Each line consists of 6 random numbers between 1 and 45.
# These values should be stored as CONSTANTS.
#
# Each line (quick pick) should not contain any repeated number.
# Each line of numbers should be displayed in sorted (ascending) order.
# Study the formatting below so that numbers align neatly.
# Note
#
# Python's random module has a sample() function, which returns a selection from a list.
# This is a nice way to solve this problem... but it's too easy :)
# Do not use it for this program.
#
# Your code should produce output that matches this sample output (except the numbers are random):
#
# How many quick picks? 5
#  1 12 14 15 30 36
#  2  5  8 33 38 41
#  2 12 19 22 29 43
# 13 21 28 29 42 43
#  3  4 10 11 32 44
